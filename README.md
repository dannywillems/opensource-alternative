# Open source alternatives to popular softwares

List of existing and must-have open source alternatives to popular softwares.

## Existing

### Communication

### Web hosting

### Project hosting

### Continuous Integration

## Must have

Sometimes or I would say often, proprietary solutions exist but no open sources
alternatives exist. Here a list of great proprietary softwares or must-have
softwares which doesn't exist any efficient alternatives to my knowledge.

### Communication

* [Franz](http://meetfranz.com/): Franz is a free messaging app / former Emperor
  of Austria and combines chat & messaging services into one application.  Franz
  is developed with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) and is very easy to use
  and to install.

### MISC

* *Desktop notification center for smartphone*: I think I'm not the only one who has his smartphone next to me when I'm
  working. I would like to have a way to communicate with my smartphone to see
  for example all notifications, all SMS, be able to launch update, etc directly
  from my computer, especially on Linux.
